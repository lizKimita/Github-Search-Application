# GithubSearch

This is an application that allows users to search for other users' profiles and repositories on Github. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5.

## Setup/ User Requirements
The user needs an internet connection to use the application.
* User inputs any user's username on Github on the searchbar provided.
* The App then shows the user's details as they appear on Github
* One can go further and look at more details about the user on Github by clicking the "User profile on Github" button.
* A list of the users repositories is also displayed and more details can be viewed as well from Github.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
